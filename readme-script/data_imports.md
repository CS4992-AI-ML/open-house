# `data_imports.py` Explanation

## Overview

The `data_imports.py` script consolidates data from multiple Excel files into a single DataFrame and exports this data to a CSV file. This process helps unify data from various sources for further analysis.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Import Required Libraries

The script begins by importing the necessary libraries:
- **`pandas`**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It is used here to read Excel files and handle DataFrames.
- **`os`**: Provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as listing files in a directory.

### 2. Read and Combine All Excel Files

```python
dfs = []
for file in files:
    df = pd.read_excel(os.path.join(path, file))
    dfs.append(df)
